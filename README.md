# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

![Game Main Page](readme-media/MainPage.gif)

This is my first mini-project after a month of learning the fundamentals of programmingðŸ˜Š.
Itâ€™s a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can either play alone (against the computer) or with a friend in two-player mode.

### Features:

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer, which has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The AI algorithms for these levels are implemented with basic logic, perfect for a beginner project.
